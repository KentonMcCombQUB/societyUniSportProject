This will be the website for the new Tag rugby society

It will be designed to allow new-comers and established players to stay up-to-date with the latest news regarding events and training times.

As well as allowing for sign ups to teams. 
- Register membership
- Available to play
- Will attend training
- More tasks & features to be added at player/ member level


At Coach/Captain level, will allow to see which members are registers, available to play, numbers expected at training, and select team sheets from these lists.
This will then allow the coaching staff & capt's to make team selections to those eligible. Those can then RSVP back to confirm. Ensuring complete team(s).
